This MATLAB project implements Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) for message transmission. It converts the message to binary, maps binary digits to BPSK symbols (-1 for 0, +1 for 1), and generates a carrier signal with "cos." Modulation is achieved by multiplying the carrier with BPSK symbols. To simulate a noisy channel, random noise is added. Demodulation involves multiplying the received signal with the carrier. Symbol detection compares demodulated signal to a threshold (0). Detected symbols are converted back to binary using "dec2bin" and "bi2de," and the final step is converting the binary message back to text with "char." The project succinctly simulates BPSK modulation and demodulation in a noisy channel.
